The "Simulated Neurological Patient Database" has been developed for a planned clinical study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive
rehabilitation utilizing immersive virtual reality. This database serves as a repository of simulated patient information, specifically designed to support the research objectives.
The database contains fictitious data that has been generated systematically to emulate realistic patient profiles.
The Simulated Neurological Patient Database, created using Python, provides researchers with a valuable resource for testing and fine-tuning their cognitive rehabilitation protocols
before applying them to real patients. By utilizing this database, researchers can explore various treatment approaches, assess their impact on cognitive improvement, and make
informed decisions regarding the implementation of immersive virtual reality in clinical practice.
Please note that all data contained within this database is purely fictional and does not represent any actual patients or their personal information. The database's purpose is 
to facilitate the development and evaluation of cognitive rehabilitation techniques and should not be used for any other purposes beyond the intended research study.
By leveraging the Simulated Neurological Patient Database, researchers can advance their understanding of cognitive rehabilitation and make significant contributions 
to the field of neurology.
